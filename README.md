```sh
pip install TikTokApi
python -m playwright install
```
If you would prefer a video walk through of setting up this package I created a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwLmLfVI-VQ) just for that.



If you're on MacOS you may need to install [XCode Developer Tools](https://webkit.org/build-tools/)

docker run -v TikTokApi --rm tiktokapi:latest python3 your_script.py
```

**Note** this assumes your script is named your_script.py and lives in the root of this directory.

### Common Issues

Please don't open an issue if you're experiencing one of these just comment if the provided solution do not work for you.

* [Browser object has no attribute verifyFp](https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api/issues/237) There's so many issues by this error please search (open and closed) issues before posting
* [Browser closed unexpectedly](https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api/issues/95)
* [BadStatusLine](https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api/issues/88)

## Quick Start Guide

Here's a quick bit of code to get the most recent trending on TikTok. There's more examples in the examples directory.

```py
from TikTokApi import TikTokApi
api = TikTokApi.get_instance()
# If playwright doesn't work for you try to use selenium
# api = TikTokApi.get_instance(use_selenium=True)

results = 10

# Since TikTok changed their API you need to use the custom_verifyFp option. 
# In your web browser you will need to go to TikTok, Log in and get the s_v_web_id value.
trending = api.trending(count=results, custom_verifyFp="")

for tiktok in trending:
    # Prints the id of the tiktok
    print(tiktok['id'])

print(len(trending))
```

To run the example scripts from the repository root, make sure you use the
module form of python the interpreter

```sh
python -m examples.getTrending
```

[Here's](https://gist.github.com/davidteather/7c30780bbc30772ba11ec9e0b909e99d) an example of what a tiktok dictionary looks like.

## Documentation

You can find the documentation [here](https://davidteather.github.io/TikTok-Api/docs) (you'll likely just need the TikTokApi.tiktok section of the docs), I will be making this documentation more complete overtime as it's not super great right now, but better than just having it in the readme!
