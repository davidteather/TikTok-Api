# Official TikTok API in Python

This is an unoffical api wrapper for tiktok.com in python. With this api you are able to call most trending and fetch specific user information.

## Important Information
* If this API stops working for any reason open an issue.
* Feel free to mention @davidteather in an issue you open, because I might not see it otherwise.

## Getting Started

To get started using this api follow the instructions below.

It is quite a long installation process just for a TikTok api, the first release can be found [here](https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api/releases/edit/v1.0) and is not as suitable for long term projects, however it may be easier for a day of scraping TikTok, as the installation is much easier.

Despite this, I **still recommend** you follow this process and use the latest version.

### Installing

If you need help installing or run into some error, please open an issue. I will try to help out as much as I can.

Tested with python 3.7.3

```
pip install TikTokApi
```

Or install directly from this GitHub repo.

* You do need to have **java installed**
* Download browsermob-proxy [here](https://bmp.lightbody.net/)
* You must add **browsermob-proxy/bin** to your environment path.
* **Firefox** must be installed.
* You must download the latest **geckodriver** from [mozilla](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases), and include the .exe in your path.

## Quick Start Guide

Here's a quick bit of code to get the most recent trending on TikTok

```
from tiktok import TikTokapi

api = TikTokapi(path_to_browsermob_directory)
# path_to_browsermob_directory - String - should be the path from the directory you are running from the code to the extracted zip file of [browsermob-proxy](https://bmp.lightbody.net/)
# Will Get the 10 most recent trending on the tiktok trending page
api.trending(10)
```

## Detailed Documentation

##### The TikTok class

```
# Variable set like
api = TikTokapi(path_to_browsermob_directory, headless=False)
```
path_to_browsermob_directory - String - should be the path from the directory you are running from the code to the extracted zip file of [browsermob-proxy](https://bmp.lightbody.net/)
headless - True/False - True means it will run a headless firefox browser, could be detected by TikTok, however it is more convienent. Default = False.


##### The Trending Method

```
# Where count is how many result you want
# Verbose is optional, default=0. Set it to 1 to get more information
api.trending(count, verbose)
```

Trending returns an array of json objects. Example structure [here](https://gist.github.com/davidteather/0be2e495e2de54098e8f2a9594581d27)

JSON object tree [here](https://gist.github.com/davidteather/bc4baef0edb621dd322c8ad128a31ac1)

##### The userPosts Method

```
api.userPosts(username="", id="", secUid="", count, verbose)
```

You can either define username OR BOTH id and secUid. Defining secUid and id is much faster than defining it by username, but it's still an option.

username - the username of the tiktok user without the @

userid - The id of the user, can be found in the TikTok json response titled "userId"

secUid - Also found in the TikTok json response the key anme is "secUid"


**Note:** Currently limited to 30 because of some issues with getting past 30. It will raise an exception if you try for higher.


Trending returns an array of json objects. Example structure [here](https://gist.github.com/davidteather/a5c1e54de353353f77a78139d2e5a9f9)

It has the same JSON object tree as trending. It's [here](https://gist.github.com/davidteather/bc4baef0edb621dd322c8ad128a31ac1) anyways.

##### The search_by_hashtag Method

```
api.search_by_hashtag(hashtag, count=10)
```

hashtag - A string of the hashtag without the # mark. Ex: hashtag = "funny"


count - The number of results you want


**Note:** Currently limited to 30 because of some issues with getting past 30. It will raise an exception if you try for higher.


Since this isn't an offical TikTok API the TikTok servers don't know what to do with my bad solutions, this takes a bit longer as it needs to find the hashtagID and stuff.

##### The get_Video_By_Url Method

```
api.get_Video_By_Url(video_url, return_bytes=0)
```

video_url - The video you want to get url.

return_bytes - The default value is 0, when it is set to 1 the function instead returns the bytes from the video rather than just the direct url.

##### The get_Related_Videos Method

```
api.get_Related_Videos(video_url)
```

This method returns the suggested trending videos titled "trends for you" on desktop. 

video_url - the video URL that you want to see related videos for 

##### The search_by_sound Method

```
api.search_by_sound(soundLink, count=10, verbose=0)
```

This method returns the trending videos under a specific sound or music link.

soundLink - Either the original sound link or the music link for a specific song.

count - Limited to 30 due to weird restrictions on the api.

verbose - 0/1 for debugging.
