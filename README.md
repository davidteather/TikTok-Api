## Getting Started

To get started using this api follow the instructions below.

### Installing

If you run into an issue please check the closed issues on the github. You're most likely not the first person to experience this issue. If nothing works feel free to open an issue.

```
pip install TikTokApi
```

The script should download pypppeteer by default, but if it doesn't run the following command.
```
pyppeteer-install
```

If you run into any issue try the fix below before posting an issue.


**If you still run into issues you may need to install chromedriver for your machine globally. Download it [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) and add it to your path.**

### Common Issues

Please don't open an issue if you're experiencing one of these just comment if the provided solution do not work for you.

* [Browser object has no attribute verifyFp](https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api/issues/237) There's so many issues by this error please search (open and closed) issues before posting
* [Browser closed unexpectedly](https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api/issues/95)
* [BadStatusLine](https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api/issues/88)

## Quick Start Guide

Here's a quick bit of code to get the most recent trending on TikTok. There's more examples in the examples directory.

```
from TikTokApi import TikTokApi
api = TikTokApi()

results = 10

trending = api.trending(count=results)

for tiktok in trending:
    # Prints the id of the tiktok
    print(tiktok['id'])

print(len(trending))
```

To run the example scripts from the repository root, make sure you use the
module form of python the interpreter

```
python -m examples.getTrending
```

[Here's](https://gist.github.com/davidteather/7c30780bbc30772ba11ec9e0b909e99d) an example of what a tiktok dictionary looks like.

If you request without bytes you will need to make a call to the URL it responds yourself to get bytes.

```

video_id - The video id you want to get.

return_bytes - The default value is 0, when it is set to 1 the function instead returns the bytes from the video rather than just the direct url.


If you request without bytes you will need to make a call to the URL it responds yourself to get bytes.
```
url = api.get_Video_No_Watermark_ID('6829267836783971589', return_bytes=0)

import requests
video_bytes = requests.get(url, headers={"User-Agent": "okhttp"}).content
```

##### The get_Video_No_Watermark Method
```
api.get_Video_No_Watermark(self, video_url, return_bytes=0, proxy=None)

This endpoint returns a url that is able to be opened in any browser, but sacrifices speed for this convenience. Any old request library can return the bytes if you decide to return a url.
