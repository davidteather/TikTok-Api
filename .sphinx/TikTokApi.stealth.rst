TikTokApi.stealth package
=========================

This package is a modified version of `playwright_stealth <https://github.com/AtuboDad/playwright_stealth>`_, used to mask the browser as a real browser.

This package is used to prevent TikTok from detecting that you are using a bot.

You probably shouldn't be interacting with this package directly, but rather through the :class:`TikTokApi` class.

Here's some stealth resources that I always keep forgetting, so I'm putting them here:

* `SannySoft Bot Detector <https://bot.sannysoft.com/>`_
* `Are you headless? <https://arh.antoinevastel.com/bots/areyouheadless>`_
    * `DataDome Detector <https://antoinevastel.com/bots/datadome>`_
* `Am I Unique? <https://amiunique.org/>`_ (cool because they split up the distribution of each field, I don't really use much)

Bot Detection Resources:

* `FingerprintJS on GitHub <https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs>`_
